i'll use Code::Blocks, since it is portable and everything..... also, i love it ^_^
if you want to use a different developement environment...  please do.
this project uses SFML, therefore you should set up your ide accordingly.
source goes to src, documentary goes to doc.
maybe i will make it more modular later... at the moment i dont see the point in splitting the code into modules.
classes should be enough... also there is no code yet... except that test thing to test wether SFML works.

at the moment sfml 1.6 is the most recent version available. or at least im using it at the moment.

also i hope i can keep it pretty portable... i plan to write the source on a windows box and on a ubuntu box...
im not sure if that will go well, but maybe its going to be allright

mail me in case of any questions
